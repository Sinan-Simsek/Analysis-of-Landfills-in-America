Business Problem

Overview
As global energy demand continues to rise, so does the need for renewable energy sources. Landfills, due to their accumulation of large amounts of waste, are a significant source of biogas (especially methane) that can be used to generate energy. However, the energy production capacity of landfills depends on many factors such as the size of the landfill, the type of waste, the amount of waste placed, and methane production.

Potential Impact
This model could assist energy companies, policymakers, and landfill managers in better understanding, planning, and optimizing the energy production potential of landfills. This could both increase energy efficiency and promote environmental sustainability by reducing carbon emissions.


Dataset Overview
This dataset contains detailed information about various landfills and projects in the United States. Each row represents a specific landfill and project. The information in the dataset includes:

GHGRP ID: The Identification Number of the landfill as per the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP).
Landfill ID: The unique identification number of the landfill.
Landfill Name: The name of the landfill.
State: The state in which the landfill is located.
City: The city in which the landfill is located or near.
County: The county in which the landfill is located.
Ownership Type: Indicates if the landfill is publicly owned, privately owned, or co-owned by public and private entities.
Landfill Owner Organization(s): The organization that owns the landfill.
Waste in Place (tons): The waste-in-place at the landfill, measured in short tons.
Waste in Place Year: The year corresponding to the waste-in-place at the landfill.
LFG Collection System In Place? Indicates whether there is a landfill gas collection system in place.
LFG Collected (mmscfd): The amount of landfill gas being collected, measured in million standard cubic feet per day.
LFG Flared (mmscfd): The amount of landfill gas flared.
Project ID: The unique identifying number combination for "parent" project and "expansion" number.
Current Project Status: The current project status.
Project Name: The specific project name (if applicable).
Project Start Date: The date the project or expansion became operational.
Project Finish Date: The date the project or expansion shut down.
Project Type Category: The category of LFG energy project type.
LFG Energy Project Type: The specific type of LFG energy project technology.
RNG Delivery Method: The method for delivery of the renewable natural gas.
LFG Use Details: Details about the use of landfill gas.
Actual MW Generation: The actual or estimated electric generation in megawatts for electricity-generating projects.
Rated MW Capacity: The rated capacity in megawatts for electricity-generating projects.
LFG Flow to Project (mmscfd): The amount of landfill gas flowing to the project or that will flow to the project when it becomes operational.
End User(s): Information about the end users of the project.
Project Developer(s): Information about the developers of the project.
Project Owner(s): Information about the owners of the project.
Product Supplier(s): Information about the suppliers of the project.
Self-Developed: Information about whether the project was self-developed.
Current Year Emission Reductions (MMTCO2e/yr) - Direct: The direct methane reductions by the energy project for the current year.
Current Year Emission Reductions (MMTCO2e/yr) - Avoided: The avoided carbon dioxide emission reductions by the energy project for the current year.
This dataset can help us understand the energy production potential and emission reduction capacity of landfills. This can both increase energy efficiency and promote environmental sustainability by reducing carbon emissions. Additionally, this dataset can be used to develop a machine learning model to predict the energy production capacity of landfills.
